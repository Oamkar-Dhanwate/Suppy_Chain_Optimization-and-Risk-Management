🛠️ Tech StackBackend: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learnMachine Learning: Random Forest (for classification), K-Means (for segmentation), Prophet (for forecasting)Dashboard: StreamlitPlotting: Plotly Express⚙️ How to Run LocallyClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name


Set up the environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the data pipeline:This script processes the raw data and trains the ML models. This step is crucial as it generates the files the dashboard depends on.python run_pipeline.py


Launch the dashboard:streamlit run dashboard/app.py
